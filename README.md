# ETI Batch Image Uploader 2020 Edition
Originally created by Tiko!! (updated by Rokem)

This program was originally developed by Tiko back in 2007 to batch upload images to LL. Unfortunately, after the domain name change to ETI, the program broke and never got any love. Fortunately, Tiko was kind enough to share the original source code with me, and I was able to update it to function properly again on ETI. With his permission, I'm now sharing this updated version with you. :D

## Installation
You have to have the Java Runtime thing 1.5 or higher to run this, which shouldn't be a problem.
It requires your ETI cookie, which I don't steal. Sniff the packets or decompile the program if you want! For help on getting this, click the ? button from the program's GUI. You can get the latest java at: www.java.com.

If you want to review the source code, check the source folder to download the project itself.
If you just want the program and dont care about the code, simply download the zip file, and extract it to a folder somewhere. Then simply run the JAR file to start the program.

## Troubleshooting
Q. WTF my image has a URL, but it shows up as a red X???
A. The image was probably too big for ETI. I think the maximum is somewhere around 5 MB.

Q. Isn't this botting ETI??? that's bannable!!!
A. Not really, it only hits the upload page, it doesn't even hit the page that gives the links! It takes up less bandwidth than doing it yourself!
   
   In fact, this is llamaguy approved!
