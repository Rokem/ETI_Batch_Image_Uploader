# ETI Batch Image Uploader 2020 Edition
Originally created by Tiko!! (updated by Rokem)

This program was originally developed by Tiko back in 2007 to batch upload images to LL. Unfortunately, after the domain name change to ETI, the program broke and never got any love. Fortunately, Tiko was kind enough to share the original source code with me, and I was able to update it to function properly again on ETI. With Tiko's permission, I'm now sharing this updated version with you. :D

## Requirements
You have to have the Java Runtime thing 1.5 or higher to run this, which shouldn't be a problem. You can get the latest java at: www.java.com. Using this program also requires your ETI cookie to function. If you're worried, sniff the packets or decompile the program if you want!

## Installation
If you just want the program and don't care about the looking at the source code:
1. Download the ETI Batch Image Uploader zip file.
2. Extract the folder somewhere.
3. Run the JAR file to start the program. :D

## How to use it
How to get your session cookie (this may vary slightly by browser):
1. Go to any End of the Internet page.
2. In the address bar, click the Shield or "Not Secure" icon next to the URL.
3. Select to view cookies, expand the endoftheinter.net section, and open the cookie folder.
4. Select PHPSESSID and copy/paste the content section into the uploader.
    * It should look something like this: 4mx15rk498fpnimgay0h8jziv3
5. Select the files you want to upload using the + button.
6. When you're ready, upload your images!

## Troubleshooting
#### Q. WTF my image has a URL, but it shows up as a red X???
**A.** The image was probably too big for ETI. I think the maximum is somewhere around 5 MB.

#### Q. Isn't this botting ETI??? that's bannable!!!
**A.** Not really, it only hits the upload page, it doesn't even hit the page that gives the links! It takes up less bandwidth than doing it yourself!

In fact, this is llamaguy approved!
